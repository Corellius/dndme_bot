DnD Me Bot
This bot will respond to a comment that says "dndme: 'character_name'" with a very rudimentary character sheet containing randomly generated ability scores and a title for the character that describes their most outstanding ability score (either outstandingly high or outstandingly low). Additional featuers, such as random race, may be added in later versions.
E.g.
