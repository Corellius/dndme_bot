DnD Me Bot
This bot will respond to a comment that says "dndme: 'character_name'" with a very rudimentary character sheet containing randomly generated ability scores and a title for the character that describes their most outstanding ability score (either outstandingly high or outstandingly low). The bot will also name what class the player should be based off their highest ability score (Str = Fighter, Dex = Rogue, Con = Knight, Int = Wizard, Wis = Cleric, Cha = Bard). Additional features, such as random race, may be added in later versions.
New feature: The bot will now perform a google search for the race and class name generated to give the user some possible appearances for their character.
E.g.

# Waluigi was labled as 'the Arrow-Catcher' because he got the highest possible Dexterity score of 18, which makes him a rogue. The bot then did a google image search for "Elf Rogue" to give some options for his character appearance.

dndme: Wario
Bot Reply:
Wario the Mighty
Strength: 17
Dexterity: 8
Constitution: 16
Intelligence: 11
Wisdom: 14
Charisma: 7

# Wario was labeled as 'the Mighty' because his most distinctive score was his abnormally high Strength, just 1 away from the max, also making him a Fighter at the same time.

Birdo the Frightener of Small Children
Class: Knight
Strength: 14
Dexterity: 13
Constitution: 15
Intelligence: 5
Wisdom: 14
Charisma: 4

# Poor Birdo meanwhile was labeled as a 'Frightener of Small Children' because her charisma score was abnormally low (just 1 away from the minimum of 3), much more noteworthy than her high of 15 in Constitution. Regardless of it not being her most significant stat though, her high score of 15 in Con still makes her a Knight.

Special thanks go to fourthofabushel for providing the framework with his inigo_bot.
